  <h2>Ethanol is classified as a primary alcohol, meaning that the carbon its hydroxyl group attaches to has at least two hydrogen atoms attached to it as well. Many ethanol reactions occur at its hydroxyl group.</h2>

<h1 style="font-size:200%;font-family:arial;background-color:lavender;">Dehydration</h1>
  <h2 style="font-size:200%;border:5px solid Violet;">
    2 CH3CH2OH → CH3CH2OCH2CH3 + H2O (ca. 120 °C)
       CH3CH2OH → H2C=CH2 + H2O (above 160 °C) </h2>

  <h1 style="font-size:200%;font-family:arial;background-color:lavender">Combustion</h1>
     <h2 style="border:5px solid Violet;">Complete combustion of ethanol forms carbon dioxide and water:

    C2H5OH (l) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l); −ΔHc = 1371 kJ/mol[92] = 29.8 kJ/g = 327 kcal/mol = 7.1 kcal/g

    C2H5OH (l) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (g); −ΔHc = 1236 kJ/mol = 26.8 kJ/g = 295.4 kcal/mol = 6.41 kcal/g[93]

   Specific heat = 2.44 kJ/(kg·K)</h2>
<h1 style="font-size:200%;font-family:arial;background-color:lavender">Acid-base chemistry</h1>
  <h2>Ethanol is a neutral molecule and the pH of a solution of ethanol in water is nearly 7.00. Ethanol can be quantitatively converted to its conjugate base, the ethoxide ion (CH3CH2O−), by reaction with an alkali metal such as sodium:[53]

    2 CH3CH2OH + 2 Na → 2 CH3CH2ONa + H2

or a very strong base such as sodium hydride:

    CH3CH2OH + NaH → CH3CH2ONa + H2

The acidity of water and ethanol are nearly the same, as indicated by their pKa of 15.7 and 16 respectively. Thus, sodium ethoxide and sodium hydroxide exist in an equilibrium that is closely balanced:

    CH3CH2OH + NaOH ⇌ CH3CH2ONa + H2O </h2>
<h1 style="font-size:200%;font-family:arial;background-color:lavender">Halogenation</h1>
    <h2>Ethanol is not used industrially as a precursor to ethyl halides, but the reactions are illustrative. Ethanol reacts with hydrogen halides to produce ethyl halides such as ethyl chloride and ethyl bromide via an SN2 reaction:

    CH3CH2OH + HCl → CH3CH2Cl + H2O

These reactions require a catalyst such as zinc chloride.[76] HBr requires refluxing with a sulfuric acid catalyst.[76] Ethyl halides can, in principle, also be produced by treating ethanol with more specialized halogenating agents, such as thionyl chloride or phosphorus tribromide.[53][76]

    CH3CH2OH + SOCl2 → CH3CH2Cl + SO2 + HCl

Upon treatment with halogens in the presence of base, ethanol gives the corresponding haloform (CHX3, where X = Cl, Br, I). This conversion is called the haloform reaction.[94] " An intermediate in the reaction with chlorine is the aldehyde called chloral, which forms chloral hydrate upon reaction with water:[95]

    4 Cl2 + CH3CH2OH → CCl3CHO + 5 HCl
    CCl3CHO + H2O → CCl3C(OH)2</h2>
<h1 style="font-size:200%;font-family:arial;background-color:lavender">Oxidation</h1>
    <h2>Ethanol can be oxidized to acetaldehyde and further oxidized to acetic acid, depending on the reagents and conditions.[76] This oxidation is of no importance industrially, but in the human body, these oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme liver alcohol dehydrogenase. The oxidation product of ethanol, acetic acid, is a nutrient for humans, being a precursor to acetyl CoA, where the acetyl group can be spent as energy or used for biosynthesis.</h2>
