	<p>Medical
Antiseptic
Ethanol is used in medical wipes and most common antibacterial hand sanitizer gels as an antiseptic. Ethanol kills organisms by denaturing their proteins and dissolving their lipids and is effective against most bacteria and fungi, and many viruses. However, ethanol is ineffective against bacterial spores.[11]70% ethanol is the most effective concentration, particularly because of osmotic pressure. Absolute ethanol may inactivate microbes without destroying them because the alcohol is unable to fully permeate the microbe's membrane.[12] [13]
Antidote
Ethanol may be administered as an antidote to methanol[14] and ethylene glycol poisoning.[15]
Medicinal solvent
Ethanol, often in high concentrations, is used to dissolve many water-insoluble medications and related compounds. Liquid preparations of cough and cold remedies, pain medication, and mouth washes may be dissolved in 1 to 25% concentrations of ethanol and may need to be avoided in individuals with adverse reactions to ethanol such as alcohol-induced respiratory reactions.[16] Ethanol is present in over 700 liquid preparations of medicine including acetaminophen, iron supplements, ranitidine, furosemide, mannitol, phenobarbital, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and over-the-counter cough medicine.[17]
Pharmacology
Ethyl Alcohol is extensively metabolized by the liver, particularly via the enzyme CYP450.[18] Ethyl Alcohol increases the secretion of acids in the stomach.[19] The metabolite acetaldehyde is responsible for much of the short term, and long term effects of ethyl alcohol toxicity.[20]
Recreational 
As a central nervous system depressant, ethanol is one of the most commonly consumed psychoactive drugs.[21] It can lift mood, cause feelings of euphoria, decrease anxiety, and increase sociability and talkativeness.[citation needed]
Fuel
Engine fuel
The largest single use of ethanol is as an engine fuel and fuel additive. Brazil in particular relies heavily upon the use of ethanol as an engine fuel, due in part to its role as the globe's leading producer of ethanol.[26] Gasoline sold in Brazil contains at least 25% anhydrous ethanol. Hydrous ethanol (about 95% ethanol and 5% water) can be used as fuel in more than 90% of new gasoline fueled cars sold in the country. Brazilian ethanol is produced from sugar cane and noted for high carbon sequestration.[27]The US and many other countries primarily use E10 (10% ethanol, sometimes known as gasohol) and E85 (85% ethanol) ethanol/gasoline mixtures.
