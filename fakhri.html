<h1>Physical Properties of Ethanol</h1>
<h2>Appearance, Odor and Taste</h2>
<h3>At room temperature, ethanol is a clear, colorless, volatile liquid with a characteristic odor. When diluted, it is somewhat sweet, but concentrated alcohol has a strong, burning taste.</h3>
<h2>Solubility</h2>
<h3>Ethanol is highly soluble in water and organic solvents, but poorly soluble in fats and oils .</h3>
<h2>Density</h2>
<h3>Density of ethanol at 68 °F (20 °C) is 0.789 g/mL .</h3>
<h2>pH</h2>
<h3>Pure ethanol is neutral (pH ~7) . Most alcoholic beverages are more or less acidic: table wine pH = 3.3-3.7 [3], beer pH ~ 4 .</h3>
<h2>Boiling Point</h2>
<h3>Boiling point of ethanol is 173.3 °F (78.5 °C) </h3>
<h2>Melting Point</h2>
<h3>Melting point of ethanol is -173.4 °F (-114.1 °C) .</h3>
<h2>Freezing Point</h2>
<h3>
    Wine (10% alcohol  by volume): 25 °F (-4 °C)</h3>
    <h3>Vodka (40% alcohol by volume): -10 °F (-23 °C)</h3>
   <h3> Pure alcohol (100% alcohol by volume): -175 °F (-115 °C)</h3>
   <h2>Flash Point</h2>
   <h3>Flash point is the temperature at which ethanol is flammable – can catch fire:</h3>
   <h3>Beer (5% alcohol by weight) can catch fire, if ignited, at 144 °F (62 °C),</h3>
   <h3>Wine (10% alcohol by weight) at 120 °F (49 °C),</h3>
   <h3>Vodka (40% alcohol by weight) at 79 °F (26 °C) [5] and</h3>
   <h3>Concentrated alcohol (96% alcohol by weight) can catch fire at 63 °F (17 °C) [5].</h3>
